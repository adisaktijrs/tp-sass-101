# tp-sass-101
It is a tutorial project (TP) about basic SASS/SCSS features from [Academind by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/css-the-complete-guide-incl-flexbox-grid-sass/).

In this course's chapter, I learn about:
- Nested selectors
- List and maps variables
- Built-in functions
- Import and partials
- Inheritance and Mixin
- Ampersand operator
